# GraphQL Profile Project – Audit Questions

## Functional
- Try to log in with invalid credentials. Is an appropriate error shown?
- Ask the student to log in with valid credentials.
- Does the profile page consist of **three sections** as required?
- Verify the accuracy of the content/information in the three sections using GraphiQL.
- Are the details presented in these sections accurate and correspond to the expected data?
- Does the profile include a **fourth section** dedicated to graphical statistics?
- Does this section contain **at least two different graphs** created using **SVG**?
- Validate the accuracy of the information presented in the graphs.
- Do the graphs display the expected data accurately?
- Try to access the profile from the host domain. Is the profile successfully accessible and hosted online?
- Log out. Is the logout functionality successful?

## General
- Does the project include all mandatory query types: **normal, nested, and with arguments**?

## Bonus
- Does the profile showcase additional information beyond the three mandatory sections?
- Are there additional graphs beyond the required two?
- Has the student created and utilized their own GraphiQL?
- Does the UI respect good practices?
